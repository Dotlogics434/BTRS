                           <strong>Introduction:-</strong> 
                           <p> Cargo Service has been facilitating our valued customers since the inception of Daewoo Express in Pakistan. Our Cargo Setups, adjacent to all terminals, are open 24/7 providing ¡®Safe & Speedy¡¯ dispatch and delivery of cargo consignments to our clients. In addition to the main bus terminals we have several Cargo collection points (for both booking and delivery) strategically located all across the country.

Traditionally, Daewoo utilized the buses for the transport of cargo, which is still being done, but with an increase in demand of our cargo service we have inducted a fleet of trucks to haul cargo across our nationwide network without compromising on time. The transit time of our trucks is comparable to Daewoo Express Buses. In short, the induction of the fleet of trucks has increased our capacity and helped us in being punctual in delivering the cargo.

Daewoo Express Cargo Service is committed to provide quality services to our valued customers. Our enhanced capacity and capabilities allow us to cater to the needs of our corporate clientele as well. We offer customer specific rates and payment terms to corporate clients.</p>
